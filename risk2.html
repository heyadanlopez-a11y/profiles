  <h2>Assessing Risk in Entra Single Sign-on using SAML</h2>
  <p>
    A brief exercise to assess the risks of creating an Enterprise App in your Entra 
    tenant to enable SAML-based single sign-on to access your Security MSP's portal.

  <h2>Scenario</h2>
  <p>
    You have a new MSP who will be providing various security services to your
    organization like log management, EDR management, and vulnerability 
    management. The MSP has a ticketing portal where you will submit tickets
    for support when needed, and they are helping you to configure access to
    the portal. The portal will be accessed using your normal company login and
    password, by enabling SAML-based single sign-on between your Microsoft 
    Entra tenant and the MSPâ€™s Entra tenant. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This risk assessment evaluates the security posture of the SAML Single Sign-On (SSO)
    implementation using Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) Enterprise Application as the Identity
    Provider (IdP) for access to the MSP portal. SAML SSO facilitates seamless and secure
    authentication by federating identity between the client organization and the MSP, 
    enabling users to leverage existing credentials without maintaining multiple passwords.
